# web-scraper

A web scraper that I am working on as a hobby project.

## Current version: Version 0.5 - Phase 1

### Phase 1:

1) Be able to open websites and extract the information. (DONE)

2) Export the information into a CSV file. (DONE)

3) Have the program compare prices for the same product on multiple websites and also compare against own prices.

4) The program should alert the user if a product has a lower price on another site. At first by writing in a text file the name of the product, the link to the product on your site, and the link to the same product on a competitor's site.

### Phase 2:

1) Build a graphical user interface to run the program.

2) Add the option to add new webpages to the scraper without needing to edit the source code.

3) Make the program text the user in case a better offer is found.

### Phase 3:

1) Set up the program so that it requires an activation code before it is run. At first, have Google Authenticator, or another similar app, provide the code.

2) Open a server that securely generates codes.

3) Write an app that connects to the server and exchanges codes securely.

4) Have the web scraper connect to the server and authenticate the usage this way.

5) Have the server detect if there is another instance of the webscraper active. If there is, ask to deactivate that instance before activating the new one.
